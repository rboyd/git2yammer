== Description
git2yammer enables you to broadcast your git commits to your company yammer account.

You need to read the Yammer API docs on how to get the consumer and access tokens and secrets.  I suggest you
create a new user just for your Git updates and authorize this app from there.

Once you have the required keys, drop them in a YAML file (default oauth.yml) like so:

consumer:
  key: YOUR_KEY_HERE
  secret: YOUR_KEY_HERE

access:
  token: YOUR_KEY_HERE
  secret: YOUR_KEY_HERE


== External Dependencies
